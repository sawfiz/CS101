Create functions for 
- fibs()
- Linked List
- Binary Search Tree

Practiced using recursive functions.

Outstanding issue:
- Tried to test my binarary search tree (BST) code using `jest`, got it to work, but it does not work well with webpack
  - A lot more configuration required.  I hacked it with help from chatGPT, but need a more systematic view
  - My jest set up did not let me use `import`, so I had to copy functions in from other js files
  - I seem to have to use `module.export` instead of just `export`
